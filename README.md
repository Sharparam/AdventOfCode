Advent of Code
==============

In this repo you can find the code for my solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)!

Languages I've been using:

 - [Lua](https://lua.org/)
 - [MoonScript](https://moonscript.org/)
 - [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/)
 - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
 - [Perl 6](https://perl6.org)

On some days I solve the problem in multiple languages. Usually first in one language I'm comfortable in to get it done fast. And then in other languages for the purpose of learning said language.
