Advent of Code
==============

In this repo you can find the code for my solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)!

Most of them are written in [Lua](http://lua.org/) or [MoonScript](http://moonscript.org/) (which compiles to Lua)
but some days I decided to write in different languages.
